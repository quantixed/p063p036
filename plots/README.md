# R Code and data for recreation of plots

The following plots can be recreated:

- Exocytosis, relocalization of INVs - `MS110_111_114_125` 
- Effective of PEG on exocytosis `MS104_105`
- Diffusion coefficient from FRAP, control vs dongle `MS130_131`
- Calculated diffusion `MS130_131`
- Exocytosis, control vs dongle `MS126_130_131`
